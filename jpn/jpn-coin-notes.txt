Notes on Coin Draft

27: "Giving more resources to open-source initiatives in electrophysiology will lead to considerable productivity benefits for scientistsâ€”even those without an inclination toward engineering."
+ I don't fully understand this sentence
+ Who is giving this support
+ Can't an open-source initiative be self sustaining? 
+ Not a bad sentence, I just think its kind of a weak note to end the intro on.

38: Companies that implement proprietary standards often prevent this. One recent example of this is the development of amplifier chips by Intan technologies
+ This makes it seem like Intan has proprietary connection standards, which it does not.

84: "In a model where systems are modular, well documented, and interoperable, companies could concentrate their resources" 
+ This is a fragment
